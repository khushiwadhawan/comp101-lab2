You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob
by sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser,
some communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what
happens using the concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure
to mention:
• Which device acts as the client :mine
• Which device acts as the server :GitHub’s computer
• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content : My browser sends a request over the internet asking the GitHub server to give it the webpage and the repository content (this is an HTTP/HTTPS request).
• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob  answer these like me :The server responds by sending the content back — the HTML, files, and data and my browser displays the GitHub repository page on the screen
